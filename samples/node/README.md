# Google Generative AI Sample for Node.js (Javascript)

This sample demonstrates how to use state-of-the-art
generative AI models (like Gemini) to build AI-powered features and applications.

To try out this sample, you'll need Node.js v18+.

## Requirements

Follow the instructions on Google AI Studio [setup page](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey) to obtain an API key.

Itâ€™s strongly recommended that you do not check an API key into your version control system. Instead, you should use a secrets store for your API key.

This sample assumes that you're providing an `API_KEY` environment variable.
